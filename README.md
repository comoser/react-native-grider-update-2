# Attention

This is not a new project, this is simply an updated version of the Tech Stack App from Stephen Grider's course "The Complete React Native and Redux Course".

This project implements the `FlatList` component (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html) instead of `ListView` (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html)

The reason behind this change can be found here: (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/better-list-views.html)
